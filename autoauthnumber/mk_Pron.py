mk_Pron.py - The core part of the Author Number library.

This is a library about automatic number-taking of "General Chinese Author Number Table".
At present, there is only one way to take the number, that is, directly looking up the table.
In the future, we will adapt to a variety of author numbering methods, please wait.
You can use the distributecode() method or fetchcode() method enter list like '[surn_name,last_porn]' to find the author number.And you can use make_pronouncation() method to get pronouncation.
